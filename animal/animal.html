        <h2>Some real facts about chickens</h2>
        <p>Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.[22] Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, 
            so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so. Before hatching, 
            the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by "pipping"; 
            pecking a breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side. The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the 
            remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell). The chick then enlarges the hole, 
            gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid. The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet 
            down dries out in the warmth of the nest.</p>

            <p>Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac. 
                Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.[25] Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first 
                often returning to the nest at night. She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for them 
                until they are several weeks old.</p>
